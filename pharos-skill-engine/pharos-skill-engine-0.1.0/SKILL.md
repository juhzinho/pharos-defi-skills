  REQUIRED for any Pharos blockchain task. This skill contains the RPC endpoints, chain IDs, explorer URLs, and token addresses needed to run cast/forge commands on Pharos — without reading it you will use wrong network config. Invoke whenever the user mentions "pharos", "PHRS", "PROS", "atlantic-testnet", or wants to do anything on the Pharos network: check balances, query transactions, call contracts, send transfers, deploy or verify Solidity contracts, run batch airdrops, or generate Web3 scripts targeting Pharos Chain / Pharos Network. Do not attempt Pharos on-chain operations without this skill.

# Pharos Chain Skills

Developer toolkit for the Pharos blockchain. Perform on-chain queries, send transactions, deploy and verify contracts via Foundry (`cast` / `forge`) CLI commands.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Foundry** (MANDATORY — MUST be done before ANY other action):
   - The Agent MUST first run `which cast` to check if Foundry is installed.
   - If `cast` is NOT found, the Agent MUST immediately run the following installation commands. **Do NOT skip installation. Do NOT fall back to curl/JSON-RPC as a workaround. Do NOT proceed with any other task until Foundry is installed.**
     ```bash
     curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
     ```
     Then run:
     ```bash
     source ~/.zshenv && foundryup
     ```
     Then verify with:
     ```bash
     cast --version
     ```
   - If installation fails, inform the user and STOP. Do not attempt alternative approaches.
2. **Configure Private Key**: Write operations (sending transactions, deploying contracts) require a private key, provided via one of the following:
   - Command argument: `--private-key <your_private_key>`
   - Environment variable: `$PRIVATE_KEY`

## Network Configuration

Network information is stored in `assets/networks.json`, containing both the Atlantic testnet and mainnet chains.

- **Default Network**: Atlantic testnet (`atlantic-testnet`). Used when the user does not specify a network.
- **Switching Networks**: When the user specifies `mainnet`, read the corresponding entry's `rpcUrl` from `assets/networks.json`.
- **Usage**: Read `assets/networks.json` and fill the target network's `rpcUrl` into each command's `--rpc-url` parameter. Contract verification also requires `chainId` and `explorerApiUrl`.

```bash
# Example: reading network configuration
RPC_URL=$(jq -r '.networks[] | select(.name=="atlantic-testnet") | .rpcUrl' assets/networks.json)
```

| Generate contract interaction scripts (read/write methods, JS/TS/Python) | Script_Generator (Agent auto-generates) | → `references/script-gen.md` |

## General Error Handling

Before executing commands, the Agent should perform pre-checks; when commands fail, provide user-friendly error messages based on stderr output.

| Error Scenario | CLI Error Signature | Handling |
|---------------|--------------------|---------| 
| Invalid address format | `invalid address` | Prompt to check address format (0x + 40 hex characters) |
| Transaction hash not found | `transaction not found` | Prompt that transaction was not found, suggest checking the hash |
| No contract code at address | Empty return value | Prompt that target address has no contract code |
| Call revert | `execution reverted` | Extract and display revert reason |
| Private key not configured | Command missing `--private-key` | Prompt user to configure private key (argument or environment variable) |
| Insufficient balance | `insufficient funds` | Prompt insufficient balance, show current balance |
| Nonce conflict | `nonce too low` | Suggest waiting or manually specifying nonce |
| Missing network config | `assets/networks.json` unreadable | Prompt that config file is missing or has invalid format |
| Unsupported network | Network name not in config list | Prompt that only `atlantic-testnet` and `mainnet` are supported |

See the corresponding reference files for detailed error handling tables for each operation.

## Security Reminders

- **Private Key Protection**: Never expose private keys in logs, chat history, or version control. Store the private key in the `$PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable and reference it explicitly in commands via `--private-key $PRIVATE_KEY`. Note: `forge` / `cast` do not automatically read environment variables; they must be explicitly passed as command arguments.
- **Network Confirmation**: Before executing write operations, the Agent must clearly inform the user of the target network (testnet or mainnet). Mainnet operations require a prominent warning and user re-confirmation to prevent accidental operations.

## Write Operation Pre-checks (Required for All Write Operations)

For all operations requiring a private key (transfers, contract calls, deployments, airdrops, etc.), the Agent must automatically complete the following checks before execution:

### 1. Private Key Check

Automatically detect whether the `$PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable is set:

```bash
# Check if environment variable exists (without outputting the private key)
[ -n "$PRIVATE_KEY" ] && echo "PRIVATE_KEY is set" || echo "PRIVATE_KEY is not set"
```

- If **not set**: Prompt the user to configure via `export PRIVATE_KEY=<your_private_key>`, do not proceed
- If **set**: Continue to next step

### 2. Derive Public Address and Confirm with User

Derive the corresponding public address from the private key via `cast wallet address`:

```bash
cast wallet address --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

### 3. Network Confirmation (Must Clearly Inform User)

The Agent must clearly inform the user of the target network before executing any write operation. Read the target network info from `assets/networks.json` and display the network name and type to the user.

- If the user did not specify a network, use the default network (`atlantic-testnet`) and clearly inform the user: **Current operation targets the Atlantic testnet**
- If the user specified `mainnet`, prominently warn the user: **Current operation targets mainnet, please confirm to proceed**

Combine the information from steps 2 and 3 for user confirmation. Example format:

```
Detected private key address: 0x1234...abcd
Target network: Atlantic Testnet (atlantic-testnet)
Proceed with this account on this network?
```

Example format for mainnet operations:

```
Detected private key address: 0x1234...abcd
⚠️ Target network: Mainnet (mainnet) — please proceed with caution
Proceed with this account on mainnet?
```

- After user confirmation, continue with subsequent operations (balance check, transaction sending, etc.)
- If user declines, stop execution

### 4. Automatic Balance Check

After confirming the account and network, automatically query the balance (see the balance check steps in each operation's Agent guidelines).
